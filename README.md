# OIBSIP_1       IRIS CLASSIFICATION

The task was to create a Machine Learning model that classifies the Iris flower correctly into its categories Iris-Setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica
I have used Logistic regression to complete this task and have produced an accuracy of 97 % with the model by parameter tuning!
